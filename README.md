The project focuses on analyzing COVID-19 death data to understand global and regional trends. It calculates total cases, total deaths, death percentages, identifies countries with the highest death tolls, and analyzes locations with the highest overall and daily infection rates relative to population.

# Methodology:

Data Acquisition: COVID-19 death data retrieved from a SQL Server database ("PortfolioProject.CovidDeaths").

Data Analysis:** SQL queries formulated to extract specific data for visualization (Global Overview, Death Counts, Infection Rates).

Data Visualization:Â Tableau used to create visualizations from the extracted data.

# Benefits:

Gain insights into the global picture of COVID-19 deaths.

Identify countries with the highest death tolls.

Analyze locations with the highest overall and daily infection rates.

Potentially identify factors influencing death rates and infection rates.

# Tools:
